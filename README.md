# ShadowChatServerV1

ShadowChat is a mobile chat binary based protocol as oppose to standard protocol like XMPP which is text based. This is the server part of the project. 

ShadowChat mainly focus on following point:
1) Fast and light
2) Security
3) Super modular and extensible

However, in this particular version, I find that some parts are done right, some parts are not. Mainly because it was shifted from another project, so are the problems from the other project into this.

Therefore, I decide to work on a revamp protocol instead of relying on this that I wrote 1 year plus ago. Thanks to the modular design, it shouldn't be a hard task.

So, I decided to open source this just for learning purposes and probably some of you can chip in some idea on what need to be fixed in upcoming version.
